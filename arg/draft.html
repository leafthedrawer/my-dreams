      l34fii,
    </p>

    <p>
      I know this is going to sound strange, but please don’t laugh it off.
      Something is wrong with leaferboy.
    </p>

    <p>
      He’s been quiet for a while, but this isn’t the normal kind.
      It feels… intentional. Like he’s waiting for something to line up.
    </p>

    <p>
      I checked the shop files earlier. WeedKiller was updated.
      Not improved. Changed.
    </p>

    <p>
      It doesn’t read like a tool anymore.
      It reads like a decision.
    </p>

    <p>
      I asked him why it doesn’t affect him.
      He smiled and said it was “obvious.”
    </p>

    <p>
      I don’t think he sees us as the same kind of thing he is.
    </p>

    <p>
      If he asks you to stay near the garden tonight, please don’t.
      If something feels off, trust it.
    </p>

    <p class="glitch">
      I tried to look deeper into the system logs and some of them
      don’t belong to today. Or to me.
    </p>

    <p>
      I think he’s already inside parts of the code he shouldn’t be.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you get this, please respond. I don’t want to be the only one
      noticing this.
